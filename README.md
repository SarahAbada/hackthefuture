# HackTheFuture – Smart Arrival Predictor 🚀

A prototype web app that uses **AI + real-world data** to predict the probability of arriving on time to an event.  
It integrates:

- **NLP**: Understands your text input like `"I need to reach my interview by 6:30pm"`  
- **Risk engine**: Combines historical transit delays, traffic, weather, and route features to estimate arrival probability.  
- **Fallback logic**: Looks realistic even when historical data is missing.  

---

## Features

- Enter a natural language plan for reaching a destination.  
- AI parses **target time and urgency**.  
- System computes an **on-time probability** using historical + live data.  
- Demo mode included with a **pre-set prompt** for instant showcase.  

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+  
- npm  
- PostgreSQL database (for historical/traffic/weather data)  
- **OpenAI API key** (for NLP parsing)

## Setup & Run (localhost)

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt install npm -y

# Mac
brew install npm

### 2️⃣ Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key and database URL:

```env
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
> If you don’t have real data yet, demo mode uses fallback values so it still works.

### 3️⃣ Run the backend
- Server runs on http://localhost:3000
- Demo prompt automatically runs and prints:
- Parsed intent from AI
- Estimated probability of arriving on time
